## Getting Started

During development, you can set up a local development environment and then deploy to a GitHub Pages repository named `username.github.io`.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imshaaz21/Awesome-Portfolio-Website-Builder.git
   ```

2. ```bash
   cd Awesome-Portfolio-Website-Builder
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Customize your portfolio by editing the `portfolio.json` file with your information.
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
6. View your portfolio locally at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

To deploy your portfolio to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository named `username.github.io` on GitHub.

   _Eg: `imshaaz21.github.io`_

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Create a directory named `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your GitHub username) and move all the build items to this directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir username.github.io
   mv docs/* username.github.io/
   ```

4. Navigate to the `username.github.io` directory:

   ```bash
   cd username.github.io
   ```

5. Initialize a new Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

6. Add the files:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

7. Commit the changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

8. Add the remote repository URL (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username):

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/username.github.io.git
   ```

9. Push to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

10. Go to the GitHub repository page of `username.github.io`. and Navigate to the `Settings` tab

11. Scroll down to the `Pages` section.

12. In the `Source` dropdown menu, select "main" branch.

13. Ensure that the root directory is set to `/`.

14. Click on `Save`.

15. Access your deployed portfolio at `https://yourusername.github.io`.

**NOTE**: Make sure to place the images and PDFs in the `public` folder.
